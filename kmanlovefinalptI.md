# Telling Stories with Data Final Project Part I

## Summary 
Technology has disrupted the entertainment industry in many ways. We have endless content at our fingertips, all packaged in a user-friendly format: **streaming**. In my final project, I aim to examine how Spotify (and streaming as a whole) has not just changed the way that we consume music, but the way artists and labels choose to make music. 

### Outline
* Show the major mediums used to listen to music and their popularity through time (vinyl sales, album sales, streams) 
* Zoom in to look at major industry trends when Spotify was launched in 2008, comparing pre- and post-Spotify era Billboard Hot 100 songs. 
* Talk about the Billboard algorithm for charting popular music and how it has begun favoring streaming. 
* Highlight the major monetary incentive for artists to change how they make music in the Spotify era (favoring shorter songs).
* Analyze song length trends in the pre- and post-Spotify eras.
* Look at song length and album length; visualize physical limitations to album length in previous eras.

## The Data
I will primarily be using data from [this dataset](https://github.com/taubergm/Billboard-Spotify-Lyrics-Music-analysis). It is well-scrubbed and the collection process is well-documented. One flaw is that this data only goes through late 2017, so I plan to use the documentation provided to collect chart and song data through the end of 2020. Other data sources I still need to find include sales of different music mediums throughout time, which should be easily accessible, and data on album length over time. I may have to choose a select few major artists and sample their albums and collect that data manually. I also plan to utilize more infographic-type visualizations and will need information on the Billboard algorithm and Spotify's royalty process, which is also easily accessible. 

## Method and Medium
My first step is to finish collecting and scrubbing the data that I need. I intend to use the Shorthand platform to build my story. I'll also look to other music data stories such as those on [pudding.cool](https://pudding.cool) for inspiration and reference. For visualizations, I intend to use Tableau. For some of the less data-heavy, more infographic style visualizations, I will likely use Adobe Photoshop, such as an illustration of media song limits as that is few data points, static, and would benefit from being more stylized.
