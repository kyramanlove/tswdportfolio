# Telling Stories with Data Final Project Part III 

## Revisions 
Since the completion of Part II, I've made a few changes.

Firstly, and most importantly, I fully honed in on what my story is: that making money is more difficult for artists in the streaming era and that's reflected in the structural changes seen in popular music. Because of this, I did remove a chart--the infographic about physical limitations of past music formats. While I do still reference it briefly to note that the lack of time limit makes the trend of shorter songs/longer albums likely to continue, I felt that it was an unnecessary detail that ultimately didn't add enough to the story. 

My user research confirmed the two audiences I had selected for my story: music industry professionals and fans. The ultimate "so what" of the story is how can musicians make streaming lucrative, and how can fans help musicians to support them in other areas. I will note that it's likely that music industry professionals are already very aware of how Spotify and others streaming services' revenue models work, so the introductory section is more for fans, although it does provide a helpful research- and data-backed perspective. 

The major design decision I had to make was on the Drake album graphic. I received a lot of feedback during my user research that while the graphic was cool, it took them some time to understand it. I wanted to maintain that format but add context, but realized as I was doing it that it became too busy with lots of callouts and explanations for what the chart meant and that interefered with its effectiveness at communicating the message. I ended up using two bar graphs in the end that got the message across, but would love to revisit another way to do that chart in the future. I also switched from "More Life" to including "If You're Reading This It's Too Late" as "More Life" is a mixtape, and felt that it was an inaccurate comparison. Along the way, one reflection I had that really stood out to me was to make sure I didn't get caught in the sunk cost fallacy. Even though I had spent a ton of time trying to rework that infographic and felt like because I had put that time and effort in that I should continue to work on it, that ultimately wasn't going to be helpful to either me or the audience in the end. 

Every chart is completely interactive and made on Tableau, save one infographic that I made on Adobe Illustrator. I got positive feedback about the interactive elements of the charts during Part II. Looking back now, while I initially did that infographic because I thought it wouldn't be possible in Tableau, I think I'd be able to make a good version of it on the platform and be able to maintain the aesthetic across all charts. 

My biggest struggle on this project was learning how to deal with time in Tableau. I learned you have to upload the data as a duration in seconds, then duplicate it to a calculated field, divide by 86400 (the number of seconds in a day) and change the format to hh:mm:ss. This took me forever, and involved a lot of googling, but I was really proud that I did not give up and switch to another platform or simplify the data in some way. It makes much more intuitive sense for the reader to see a song length in mm:ss format, rather than 240 seconds.
