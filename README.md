Spring 2021 Telling Stories with Data

# About me
Hello! I'm a student in the Telling Stories with Data course. My name is Kyra Manlove (she/her) and I am in the Master of Entertainment Industry Management program at Carnegie Mellon University. I want to work in the television / film sector in either a talent agency, development or production. Prior to coming to CMU, I worked as a Data Analyst at an advertising agency. 

# What I hope to learn 
While I do have experience as a Data Analyst, the insights division was a newer department at my company and thus lacked a lot of best practices when visualizing our data. Since we were mainly self-taught, I want to learn the proper way to think about data visualization and storytelling. I also hope to gain important perspective for my industry, since many going into entertainment don't tend to have an analytical or data-driven background, despite data being a vital part of decision-making for entertainment.
